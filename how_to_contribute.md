# Reggie Contribution

Reggie is currently maintained by the engineering team at Voteshield, which is a data analytics tool designed to protect the integrity of American elections by monitoring changes to the voter rolls. There are many ways to contribute, by adding a new state to the ingestion tool, or speeding up the tool itself, or even adding more documentation.  
If you've never contributed to OSS before and want some more personalized help, feel free to reach out to [Voteshield](https://voteshield.us) or to [Tyler Richards](http://www.tylerjrichards.com/) for individualized help. If you feel more comfortable contributing, a great place to start is in download.py where each state has its own function (e.g. preprocess_ohio).
