#Florida provides two .zip files: Voter Extract and Voter History. Depending on the vintage they will have different naming conventions (most recently the files are "Voter_Registration_20180510.zip" and "Voter_History_20180510.zip". Both zips contain 67 separate .txt files, one for each county. "ALA_20061010.txt" would be for Alachua county from Oct 10 2006. These files DO NOT have headers.
