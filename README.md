# Veggie

Veggie is a command line interface for working with state voter registration files.

## What is a Voter File

Voter files, often referred to as voter registration lists, are files kept by state governments to determine which citizens are registered and eligible for elections. Each state keeps a voter file, has different information about each voter (sometimes keeping race, gender, email, phone number, address, and other information), charges a different amount for this public file (Ohio and North Carolina are free, while some states charge more than $10k for a file), and also keeps these files in different formats. These issues make them difficult to read into R/Python/Stata and to analyze. 

## Example Use Case: Florida
